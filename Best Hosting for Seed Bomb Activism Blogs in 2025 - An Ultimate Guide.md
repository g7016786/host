GreenGeeks positions itself as the most eco-friendly web hosting provider, which aligns perfectly with the values of seed bomb activism. They offer a range of hosting options and a commitment to sustainability.

### Environmentally Conscious Hosting:
GreenGeeks stands out by purchasing three times the amount of renewable energy they consume in the form of wind energy credits. This commitment helps offset their carbon footprint and supports a greener internet. If your activism focuses on environmental issues, associating your blog with a green hosting provider reinforces your message.

### Scalable Hosting Solutions:
GreenGeeks provides shared, VPS, and dedicated hosting plans. For a new blog, their shared hosting might be sufficient. However, as your audience grows and your blog requires more resources, you can easily scale up to a VPS or dedicated server. This scalability ensures that your website can handle increasing traffic and remain responsive.

### Feature-Rich Plans:
Even their basic shared hosting plans include unlimited storage, unlimited bandwidth, free SSL certificates, a free domain name for the first year, and a free CDN. These features contribute to a faster, more secure, and user-friendly experience for your visitors. They also offer a one-click WordPress installer for easy setup.

### Security Measures:
GreenGeeks implements several security measures to protect your website from online threats. These include real-time security scanning, proactive server monitoring, DDoS protection, and automatic nightly backups. Security is paramount for any website, especially one advocating for potentially controversial issues.

### Pricing:
GreenGeeks' pricing starts at around $2.99 per month for their Lite plan. While this is an introductory price, it offers excellent value for the features included. Higher-tier plans offer additional resources and features for larger or more demanding websites. Remember that pricing can vary based on contract length and promotional offers.
